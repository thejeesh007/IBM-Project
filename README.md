I built an AI-powered educational tool for students to help them study efficiently by utilizing Generative AI. The proposed objectives included:
•	Designing a modern and elegant frontend UI for students.
•	Integrating pre-trained language models to perform summarization, flashcard generation, and quiz generation.
•	Enabling interactive chatbot support for student doubts using speech and text.
Study Sphere is a feature-rich, interactive AI tool built for students.
From smart summarization to gamified quizzes and flashcards, it showcases the power of Generative AI when combined with a polished frontend. 
The project emphasizes the practical usability of AI in education and serves as a base for more advanced e-learning innovations.
